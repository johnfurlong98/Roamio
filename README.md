## Introduction

Roamio is a travel destination website, and the name "Roamio" symbolizes the joy of exploring new places and the spirit of adventure. Roamio has been developed as part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer course as my final projectâ€”focusing on Django and Bootstrap frameworks, database manipulation, and CRUD functionality.

## Design Inspiration

The design inspiration behind the Roamio website is rooted in creating a visually appealing and inviting user experience. With a focus on travel and adventure.
The choice of a background contributes to a clean and minimalist aesthetic, providing a canvas for the vibrant color scheme that reflects the diversity of destinations featured on the website.

The logo name Roamio, serves as a visual representation of the website's name and theme. By incorporating elements related to travel, the logo reinforces the concept of discovery and adventure.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme for Roamio has been carefully selected to create a modern and visually appealing experience, reflecting the themes of exploration and travel.

**Primary Color (Blue): `#4A90E2`**  
This custom blue color is used throughout the site, primarily in the navigation bar, buttons, and headings. It represents the open sky and ocean, symbolizing the freedom and adventure associated with travel.

**Secondary Color (Gray): `#555`**  
A subtle gray color is applied to text in various sections of the website, providing a clean and neutral contrast to the primary blue and white backgrounds.

**Background Color (Light Gray): `#f5f5f5`**  
Used as the background for the main content area and certain sections, this light gray color gives the website a clean and modern feel, ensuring readability and focus on the content.

**White Backgrounds: `#ffffff`**  
White is utilized for the list items, forms, and other content blocks, maintaining a minimalist and uncluttered look. It provides a strong contrast against the blue accents, making the site feel open and airy.

**Hover Effects:**

- **Button Hover (Darker Blue): `#357ABD`**  
  On hover, buttons darken to a richer blue, providing a clear visual feedback for users and enhancing the interactive experience.

- **Social Icons Hover (Yellow): `#F8E71C`**  
  Social icons enlarge slightly and change to yellow on hover, drawing attention and inviting users to interact.

This combination of colors ensures that Roamio is not only visually attractive but also aligns with the thematic elements of travel, making the user experience both engaging and intuitive.

#### Project Status and Request for Extension
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the project and the README by the original deadline. Despite working diligently and putting in long hours, I encountered some challenges and struggled with the learning process, which has affected my progress and sleep.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I am requesting an extension to finalize the project and ensure it meets the highest standards. Thank you for your understanding and patience.

If not maybe it is possible that this project can still achieve a grade.
